			<h3>Instructions:</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>In a mixing bowl, combine milk powder, all-purpose flour, ghee, and baking soda. Mix these dry ingredients well.</li>
				<li>Gradually add milk to the mixture, stirring continuously, until you achieve a soft and smooth dough. Ensure there are no lumps.</li>
				<li>Take small portions of the dough and shape them into round balls. Ensure they are smooth and without cracks.</li>
				<li>Heat ghee or oil in a pan over medium heat. Deep-fry the shaped dough balls until they turn golden brown. Maintain a medium-low heat to cook them evenly.</li>
				<li>In a separate pan, combine sugar and water to make a sugar syrup. Boil until it reaches a slightly sticky consistency.</li>
				<li>Once the jamuns are fried, gently place them in the sugar syrup. Allow them to soak for a few hours, allowing the jamuns to absorb the sweetness.</li>
				<li>Garnish the Gulab Jamun with saffron strands for an extra touch of flavor. Serve them warm, and enjoy the delightful sweetness!</li>
